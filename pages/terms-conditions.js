            You must follow any policies made available to you within the
            Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do not misuse our Services, for example, do not interfere with our
            Services or try to access them using a method other than the
            interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use the

          </p>

          <p>
            Using the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual
            property rights in the Services or the content that you access. You
            may not use content from the Services unless you obtain permission
            from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not
            grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in the

            displayed in or along with the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Services display some content that is not ours. This content is
            the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available.
          </p>

          <p>
            In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
            announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You
            may opt-out of some of those communications, but not all of them.

          <p>
            Some of the Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use
            such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from
            obeying traffic or safety laws.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, you agree that you will not, and will not allow third

          </p>

          <h3>4. Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we treat your
            personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By
            using our Services, you agree that we can use such data in
            accordance with our Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h3>5. About Software in our Services</h3>
          <p>
            When the Service requires or includes downloadable software, this
            software may be updated automatically on your computer or other
            device once a new version or feature is available.
          </p>

          <p>
            We give you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
            non-exclusive license for the term of your subscription to use the
            software provided to you by us as part of the Services. This license
            is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit
            of the Services as provided by us in the manner permitted by these
            terms.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Your Content in our Services</h3>
          <p>
            Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or
            receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property
            rights that you hold in that content. In other words, what belongs
            to you stays yours.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or
            through our Services, you give us (and those we work with) a
            worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create
            derivative works (such as those resulting from translations,
            adaptations, or other changes that we make so that your content
            works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly
            perform, publicly display, and distribute such content.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rights that you grant in this license are for the limited
            purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to
            develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our
            Services.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>
          <p>
            We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or
            remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a
            Service altogether.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry
            to see you go. We may also stop providing Services to you, or add or
            create new limits to our Services at any time.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Liability for our Services</h3>
          <p>
            We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of
            skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there
            are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Except as expressly provided in these terms and your subscription
            agreement, we don’t make any specific promises about the Services.
            For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within
            the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their
            reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide
            the Services “as is”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied
            warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all
            warranties.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the extent permitted by law, we will not be responsible for lost
            profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special,
            consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of us, and our
            suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms,
            including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount that
            you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you
            with the Services again).
          </p>

          <p>
            We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as
            a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose,
            then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any
            consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Business uses of our Services</h3>
          <p>
            If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business
            accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify us and our
            affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or
            action arising from or related to the use of the Services or
            violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising
            from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and
            attorneys’ fees.
          </p>

          <h3>10. About these Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a
            Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to
            our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. If you do not
            agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue
            your use of that Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms,
            the additional terms will control for that conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            These terms control the relationship between us and you. They do not
            create any third party beneficiary rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action
            right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that
            we may have (such as taking action in the future).
          </p>

          <p>
            If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will
            not affect any other terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of
            laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to
            these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating
            to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the
            federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and
            you and we consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
